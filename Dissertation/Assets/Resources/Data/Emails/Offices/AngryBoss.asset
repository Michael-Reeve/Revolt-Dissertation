  emailContents: 'Look. I know they''re fun. I know they can even be a good way to
    spend a break.


    But they''re not just a toy. These have a real, functional purpose. That bridge
    is supposed to remain out of access. Furthermore, their presence has lead to a
    massive decrease in productivity. Because of this, I will be locking them in the
    locker.


    If anyone gets them out, I''ll expect a letter of resignation.'
