  emailContents: "Ivan! \n\nJust what kind of operation are they running here? How
    do you always manage to find security detail positions for us at the craziest
    places? The other night I peeked through the doors to R&D as some of the whitecoats
    were showing up for their shifts... they've got some big-ass mehcanical bridge
    hanging over some insane complex, whilst they've got us out here guarding a glorified
    children's puzzle! I mean the unmanned reception computers are just old CRT monitors,
    they don't even work! They won't give our cards access to the main complex, but
    if you were able to get one of the researcher's cards, you might be able to treat
    yourself to a fun midnight stroll...\n\n... you know, if you're not shot and thrown
    into a barrel of acid.\n\nJust saying.\n\nHarry"
