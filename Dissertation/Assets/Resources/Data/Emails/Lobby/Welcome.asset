    and artificial intelligence.


    We hope that you enjoy your stay here, and if you need anything, please just speak
    to our receptionist at the front desk. You will have to make your way through
    security first. In order to progress further than the lobby, you will be required
    to sign a non-disclosure agreement.


    Again, we wish you the best, and enjoy your stay.'
