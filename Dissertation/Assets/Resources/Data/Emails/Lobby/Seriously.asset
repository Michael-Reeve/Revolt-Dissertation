    Are they serious?


    Look, I know that I''ve been pretty lenient about the whole Ava thing. But for
    god''s sake, she''s been recently widowed, and that was their fault! I won''t
    hold it against her if she forgets something on her way to work every so often.
    I''ll keep a spare keycard aside for her, just in case.


    You gonna be alright over there? I know that last month you guys caught Oskar
    trying to download data from the servers. Hopefully that was the only incident
    - honestly, I think it''s that which put them on edge.


    See you soon.'
