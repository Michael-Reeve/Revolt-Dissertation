  emailContents: 'Over the past few weeks we have moved to a point where we are ready
    to move into preliminary testing on our latest technology. Obviously, due to the
    high value and sensitivity of our work here, we cannot allow neither interruption
    nor infiltration. As a result, we are asking all of our security staff to ramp
    up on measures. Even if Ava forgets her pass again. No exceptions.


    We thank you for your understanding and continued hard work. You can rest assured
    that the christmas bonuses will be exceptional.




    Security Chief Sigurdsson.'
